# ISOMAP
Order of faces

The file isomap.mat (or isomap.dat) contains 698 images, corresponding to different poses of the same face.
Each image is given as a 64 Ã— 64 luminosity map, hence represented as a vector in R^4096

(1). Visualize the nearest neighbor graph.

(2). ISOMAP algorithm to obtain a two-dimensional low-dimensional embedding. Plot the embeddings using a scatter plot.
